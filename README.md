# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Predicting

## About

This project is about using the data provided by the government to predict the resale prices of the singapore flatts. The was downloaded from the website www.data.gov.in. Then the data was pre processed and used for a regression machine learning model building. With help of the machine learning model we can predict the resale price. The model was deployed into a streamlit app for predicting the price.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

## Technologies Used

1. Python
2. Streamlit
3. Scikit Learn
4. XGBoost
5. Pandas
6. Numpy

12. Statistics

## Deliverables

1. A well-trained machine learning model for resale price prediction.
2. A user-friendly web application (built with Streamlit) deployed on Any Cloud Platform
3. Documentation and instructions for using the application.
4. A project report summarizing the data analysis, model development, and deployment process.

## Pre Processing Machine Learning Model Building.

Step-1:
First the data set has to be downloaded from the official website.
